# Future Plans & Ideas

> A running list of larger features we'd like to explore once the core map + CRUD experience is solid.

## 1. Classifieds / Marketplace

- Allow users to post skate-related items for sale (decks, trucks, shoes, cameras, etc.).
- Each listing tied to a user profile; DM or email contact.
- Basic categories + search; optional price filter.

## 2. Spot Sharing (QR & Deep-Link)

- Generate a shareable URL for every spot (`/spots/{id}`) with OpenGraph meta so it previews nicely in chats.
- "Print QR" button that renders a QR code pointing at the spot URL (SVG download). Perfect for flyers or stickers.
- One-tap "Navigate" that opens the spot in Google Maps directions from the user's current location.

## 3. Friends / Connections

- Simple friend system: send / accept requests.
- Fast add via QR code on profile (scan to follow/friend).
- Show friends' recent spot check-ins or comments first.
- Optional "Meet up" status a user can toggle to let friends know they're skating now.

_Features above are speculative and live here until we schedule them into a milestone or reject them._
